[Power Grid Simulator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-K7CExFenf-power-grid-simulator) was developed to facilitate the management of energy distribution in smart power grids, particularly those integrating renewable energy sources like solar panels. This tool simulates interactions between household solar panels, battery storage systems, and central grid management tools. By providing real-time simulations under various conditions, it helps stakeholders understand how these components interact and can be optimized for efficiency. The simulator offers insights into energy flows, storage levels, and potential adjustments needed to enhance the system's performance.

Power Grid Simulator can be incredibly beneficial for utility managers, energy consultants, and homeowners interested in using renewable energy efficiently. It analyzes data from solar panels and battery systems to recommend strategies for energy distribution and storage, taking into account factors such as weather conditions and demand patterns. This helps in maximizing energy efficiency, ensuring the sustainable use of resources, and reducing the carbon footprint of energy systems. Ultimately, it supports the development of more resilient and environmentally friendly energy infrastructures.
